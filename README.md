# Tauri Plugin clipboard

## Example

```bash
npm run build
cd examples/svelte-app
npm run tauri dev
# there are a few buttons you can click to test the clipboard plugin
```

See [App.svelte](examples/svelte-app/src/App.svelte) for an example of how to use the plugin in JS/TS.

It works the same with other frontend frameworks like Vue, React, etc.
