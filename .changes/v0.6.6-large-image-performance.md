Changes:
- Make commands `read_image_base64`, `read_image_binary`, `write_image_base64`, `write_image_binary` async to avoid blocking the main thread while dealing with large screenshots.

In debug mode reading a large image could be slow (~7 seconds) but in release mode it's fast (< 1 seconds).

After making the image-related commands async, there should not be any noticeable delay in release mode.
