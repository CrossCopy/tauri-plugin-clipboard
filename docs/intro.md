# Introduction


A Tauri plugin for clipboard read/write/monitor. Support text, rich text, HTML, files and image.

The reason I built this plugin is becasue official Tauri API only supports clipboard read and write for text, not image, HTML, rich text or files. So you can still use the official API for text.

Update: V2 now supports text, HTML, and image.
